*************  Pseudo-Code Example of Reading Data from FIFO  ********************

**** First transaction: Get the FIFO_WR_PTR ****
START;
Send device address + write mode Send address of FIFO_WR_PTR; REPEATED_START;
Send device address + read mode Read FIFO_WR_PTR;
STOP;
The central processor evaluates the number of samples to be read from the FIFO:
NUM_AVAILABLE_SAMPLES = FIFO_WR_PTR â€“ FIFO_RD_PTR
NUM_SAMPLES_TO_READ <= NUM_AVAILABLE_SAMPLES 


**** Second transaction: Read NUM_SAMPLES_TO_READ samples from the FIFO ****
START;
Send device address + write mode
Send address of FIFO_DATA;
REPEATED_START;
Send device address + read mode
for (i = 0; i < NUM_SAMPLES_TO_READ; i++) { Read FIFO_DATA;
Save IR[15:8];
Read FIFO_DATA;
Save IR[7:0];
Read FIFO_DATA;
Save R[15:8];
Read FIFO_DATA;
Save R[7:0];
} STOP;


**** Third transaction: Write to FIFO_RD_PTR register **** 
** If the second transaction was successful, FIFO_RD_PTR points to the next sample in the FIFO, 
and this third transaction is not necessary. Otherwise, the processor updates the 
FIFO_RD_PTR appropriately, so that the samples are reread.
START;
Send device address + write mode Send address of FIFO_RD_PTR; Write FIFO_RD_PTR;
STOP;
